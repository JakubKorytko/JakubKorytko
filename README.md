## 🚀 About Me
I'm Junior dev from Poland.  
I graduated from the best IT school in my country (ZSŁ in Cracow).  
I spent a large part of my life on coding.  
Created indie game studio called LizardsGames (8-person team).  
For frontend I mainly use React, and when it comes to backend I use NodeJS on Nginx server.  
My main choice for databases is MySQL and for scripts I'm using Python.  
I'm also interested in AI, astronomy and video games.
